Q1. Linux Commands:
	
	1. pwd - gives the path of present working dir.
	2. top - Display linux process
	3. less - opposite of more
	4. man - an interface to the on-line reference manuals
	5. cat - concatenate files and print on the standard output
	6. chmod - change file mode bits
	
	
Q2. Difference Between chmod a+x and chmod 755:

	chmod a+x modifies the argument's mode while chmod 755 sets it.



Q3. REPL:

	Interactive Ruby Shell (IRB or irb) is a REPL for programming in the object-oriented scripting language Ruby. The abbreviation 
	i r b comes from the fact that the filename extension for Ruby is ".rb", although interactive Ruby files do not have an 
	extension of 		".irb".




Q4. Iterators:

	Iterators are not an original concept with ruby. They are in common use in object-oriented languages. They are also used in 
	Lisp, though there they are not called iterators. However the concept of iterator is an unfamiliar one for many so it should be 	explained in more detail.

	The verb iterate means to do the same thing many times, you know, so an iterator is something that does the same thing many 
	times.

	When we write code, we need loops in various situations. In C, we code them using for or while. For example,

	char *str;
	for (str = "abcdefg"; *str != '\0'; str++) {
	  /* process a character here */
	}

	C's for(...) syntax provides an abstraction to help with the creation of a loop, but the test of *str against a null character 
	requires the programmer to know details about the internal structure of a string. This makes C feel like a low-level language. 
	Higher level languages are marked by their more flexible support for iteration. Consider the following sh shell script:

	#!/bin/sh

	for i in *.[ch]; do
	  # ... here would be something to do for each file
	done



Q5. Open Classes: 

	In Ruby, classes are never closed: methods can always be added to an existing class. This applies to all classes, including the 	standard, built-in classes. All that is needed to do is open up a class definition for an existing class, and the new contents 
	specified will be added to the existing contents.



Q6. Ruby Program to overload '+' operator:

	class Tester1
	 def initialize x
	   @x = x
	 end
	 def +(y)
	   @x.to_s + y.to_s
	 end
	end
	a = Tester1.new 11.to_s
	puts(a+22)
